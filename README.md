# 10 Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

## User Story

AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated


## Getting Started

The application will be invoked by using the following command:
node index.js


├── dist/                  // rendered output (HTML) and CSS style sheet
├── src/                   // template helper code 
├── index.js               // runs the application

**Important**: Make sure that you remove `dist` from the `.gitignore` file so that Git will track this folder and include it when you push up to your application's repository.

The application must include `Employee`, `Manager`, `Engineer`, and `Intern` classes. The tests for these classes (in the `_tests_` directory) must ALL pass.
